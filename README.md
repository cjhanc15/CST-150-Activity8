# CST-150-Activity8

# Calorie Converter

## Summary:

1. In this application, I challenged myself to learn more about Dark Mode, when it comes to styling. I had not created my own app in Dark Mode before, but a lot of users, including myself, tend to use dark mode to avoid eye strain. The story of the user who this app was created for will be using this app for work, meaning they might want it to be a little easier on their eyes.

2. I did not run into any challenges during this activity because the previous activities have prepared me well up to this point.

## How to Use:

1. Type in a valid number of grams of fat (whole number).
